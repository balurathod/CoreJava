JSP has 3  main capabilities of including and external pieces in JSP document:
1. The jsp:include action (text/html/jsp)
2. The include directive (text/html/jsp)
3. The jsp:plugin action (applet)

The jsp:include action

a. The content of HTML page
b. The content of plain text document
c. The output of JSP page
d. The output of Servlet

NOTE : The page is included at the time of request
Syntax

<jsp:include page="relative path of the resource" />

Or
<jsp:include page="relative path of the resource" > </jsp:include>

Attribute :
page* : specifies the external page to be includes
flush(optional): default value is false
	specifies whether buffer should be flushed before 	inclusion

Example:
	WhatsNew.jsp
	Uses : Item1.html,Item2.html and Item3.html

The Param element

<jsp:include page="StadardHeadings.jsp">
<jsp:param name="bgColor" value="Yellow">
</jsp:include>


In the RequestedPage :StandardHeadings.jsp

String str = request.getParameter("bgColor");

The Include Directive
Note : The page is included at the time of page translation.


<%@ include file="Relative URL" %>


Differences between jsp:inlude action and include directive
		jsp:include		include
		action		directive

Basic Syntax	<jsp:include>	<%@ include
		</jsp:include>	%>

Inclusion time	Request		Translation

What is included ?	Output		Actual content 				of file
How many servlets
result ?		Two		One

Can included page	No		Yes

define fields or 
methods that
main page use

Does main page needs	No		Yes

		of 
		RequestDispatcher

Example: Reusing Footers

SomeRandomPage.jsp
	makes use of ContactSection.jsp

Forwarding Request with jsp:forward

<% String destination
	if(Math.random()>.5)
	{
		destination = " Page1.jsp"
	}
	else
	{
		destination = " Page1.jsp"
	}
%>
<jsp:forward page="<%= destination> " />

The jsp:plugin element

Example
<jsp:plugin type="applet"
	code="SomeApplet.class"
	height=400 width=400>
</jsp:plugin>	

Attributes:
type: applet,bean
code
width
height

The param element
The params element

<jsp:plugin type="applet"
	code="SomeApplet.class"
	height=400 width=400>
	<jsp:params>
<jsp:param name="Param1" Value="Value1"/>
<jsp:param name="Param1" Value="Value1"/>
	</jsp:params>
</jsp:plugin>	

The fallback element

Example
<jsp:plugin type="applet"
	code="SomeApplet.class"
	height=400 width=400>
<jsp:fallback> 
<b> This example requires Java</b>
</jsp:fallback>
</jsp:plugin>
